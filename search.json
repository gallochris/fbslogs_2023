This data can be used to analyze recent rule changes.\nData sources\nThe data used on this site is provided by SportSource Analytics. You can find similar data by purchasing one of the data packages.\nHistorical data is corroborated using cfbfastR, stats.ncaa.org, and collegefootballdata.com.\nData definitions\nduration of games are listed in minutes, and includes games between at least one FBS team\nif a game includes a weather delay, it’s at the discretion of the scorekeeper if the delay is included in the duration\nfor example, Miami (OH) and UMass played a 410 minute game, however, there was a five hour delay\n\ncombined plays only tracks total offensive plays, so rushing and passing attempts, for games between two FBS teams.\nplay data does not include other play types (kickoff, punts, field goals, etc. )\n\ncombined drives includes all raw data and any “garbage” time drives for games between two FBS teams\nHow this site was built\nThis website was built by me, Chris Gallo. I write a weekly newsletter, Bless your chart, about college sports. If you have any questions, please send me an email.\nThe site is built using the Distill framework. All data manipulation is done using R programming language.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
